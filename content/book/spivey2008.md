The book was originally published by Prentice-Hall in 1996, but is
long out of print and the rights have been reverted to the author. It
gives a simple introduction to the theory of logic programming, and
also describes in detail an implementation of a small Prolog dialect
called picoProlog by an interpreter written in Pascal.
